		<SteelUmbrella.label>steel umbrella</SteelUmbrella.label>
		<SteelUmbrella.description>An umbrella made of solid steel, which can be held or propped up to cover your head while you shoot from underneath it. It's good protection from headshots in a firefight, but very heavy and unwieldy. Plus, in a pinch, it'll keep you dry (warranty invalid if umbrella suffers damage from rust).\n\nnote: not compatible with helmets because... uh... magnets or something</SteelUmbrella.description>
